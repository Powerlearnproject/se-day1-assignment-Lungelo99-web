Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the structured process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software to ensure reliability, efficiency, and scalability. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Drives innovation across industries.
2. Ensures secure, scalable software solutions.
3. Automates processes and improves efficiency.
   
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Structured Programming (1960s-70s) – Modular, readable code.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-90s) – Reusable, scalable software.
3. Agile & DevOps (2000s-Present) – Faster, collaborative development.
Phases of SDLC
A. Planning – Define scope & requirements.
B. Analysis – Gather stakeholder needs.
C. Design – Create system architecture.
D. Implementation – Develop & test code.
E. Testing – Identify and fix bugs.
F. Deployment – Release software.
G. Maintenance – Update & improve

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall – Linear, best for stable projects (e.g., banking).
2. Agile – Iterative, great for evolving needs (e.g., mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer – Writes & maintains code.
2. QA Engineer – Tests software for bugs.
3. Project Manager – Oversees timelines & communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) – Provide coding tools.
2. VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub) – Track changes, enable collaboration

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight Deadlines – Use project management tools.
2. Debugging Issues – Apply structured testing.
3. Keeping Up with Tech – Continuous learning.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit – Tests individual components.
2. Integration – Checks module interactions.
3. System – Validates the entire application.
4. Acceptance – Ensures it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting precise instructions to get the best AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
